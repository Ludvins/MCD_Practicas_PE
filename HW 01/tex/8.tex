\textbf{Exercise 8.} \textit{Make an animation in Python illustrating the evolution of the distribution of a Brownian motion process starting form $x_0$:}
\[
\mathbb P(B(t)=x\mid B(t_0)=x_0).
\]
\textit{To this end, simulate $M$ trajectories of the process in the interval $[t_0 , t_0 + T ]$ and plot the time evolution of the histogram using as frames a grid of regularly spaced times in that interval. Plot the theoretical form of the density function on the same graph, so that it can be compared with the histogram.}

\textit{Solution.} We make an animation using the library \href{https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/animation_api.html}{\texttt{matplotlib.animation}}, which can be viewed in the attached notebook.
