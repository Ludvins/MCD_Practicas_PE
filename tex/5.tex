\textbf{Exercise 5. }\emph{Consider the process \( X(t) = X\sqrt{t} \) for \( t \geq 0 \) withthe same value of \( Z \) for all \( t \).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textit{a)}] \emph{Show that the distribution of the process at time \( t \) is the same as that of a Wiener process: \( X(t) \sim \mathcal(N)(0, \sqrt{t}) \).
  \item[\textit{b)}] \emph{What is themathematical property that allows us to prove that this process is not Brownian?}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Solution. }
\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textit{a)}] Assuming \( Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \) and using that the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution is altered :
        \[
        X(t) = X \sqrt{t} \sim \sqrt{t}\mathcal{N}(0, 1) = \mathcal{N}(0, t).
        \]
  \item[\textit{b)}] The mathematical property that this process does not fulfill is
\end{itemize}
